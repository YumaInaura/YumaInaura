## 1. Add a gem 

Simply install resque.

     gem 'resque' 

     $ bundle install 

## 2. Write the content of execution 

Write the processing you want the worker to execute in the `perform` method of the model. Here, as a test, create a process that only outputs standard.

     class Example @queue = :default def self.perform p 'Hello Sword!' end end 

## 3. Configure settings for workers 

You only need to add one line to the Rakefile.

     require 'resque/tasks' 

## 4. Launch a worker 

`$ TERM_CHILD=1 QUEUES=* bundle exec rake environment resque:work`

 

When launched, nothing happens now. That's because workers don't hesitate until the job is registered. Let's leave it for now.

## 5. Register a job 

Let's add a job on another tab (separate window) from the worker. It's easy to use the Rails console.

`$ bundle exec rails console`

 

     irb(main)> Resque.enqueue(Example) => true 

If successful, `true` will be returned.

## 6. The job is run 

After a few seconds, let's go back to the worker tab above. **You will see** that the job **"standard output string"** is being executed.
