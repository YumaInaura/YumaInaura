Specify as follows.

     def initialize(user) can :update, ExampleClass can :create, ExampleClass end 

Let's specify four types of CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete).

Note that edit / new / index / show does not exist because it is not strictly an "action name". For example, if you allow update with CanCan, Rails will allow two actions, update and edit.

* * *

Correspondence is as follows. (Specified in CanCan =\> action in Rails)

- read =\> index + show 
- update =\> update + edit 
- create =\> new + create 
- delete =\> delete   
- manage =\> all the above actions 

* * *

-A note because it did not hit even if it is gugging with "CanCan action authority".
