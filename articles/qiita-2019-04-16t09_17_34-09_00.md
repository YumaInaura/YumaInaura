This does not work well.

     gem 'activeadmin' 

It is no use doing according to the [official](http://activeadmin.info/docs/documentation.html) .

     # Gemfile in Rails >= 3.1 gem 'activeadmin' gem 'sass-rails' gem "meta_search", '>= 1.1.0.pre' 

do this.

     gem 'activeadmin', github: 'activeadmin' 

     $ bundle install 

did it!

# problem 

Depending on the Rails version, trying to install a bundle will just give an error. It is said to delete meta\_search, but I did not understand well.

`Your Gemfile requires gems that depend on each other, creating an infinite loop. Please remove gem 'meta_search' and try again.`

 
# environment 

- Rails 4.2.4 
- ruby 2.2.3 
- Bundler version 1.10.6
