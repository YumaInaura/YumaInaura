# demand 

There is a demand for what people are asking "What is that?"

For example, when showing a person's own display and operating it. "What is that command?" **Even if it is natural to you,** it is often the **command** that **people do not know**.

Let's actively make it a neta.

# Example 

For example, in my case, every article that has a lot of stock. People were asked, "What is that?"

- [How to open file from last line in vi / vim](http://qiita.com/Yinaura/items/8e152972017189fd7085) 
- [How to increase the speed of bundle install 1.5 times. (Parallel execution)](http://qiita.com/Yinaura/items/317be4f158be9c3fa1aa) 
- [Vim | Unexpectedly do not know: x command (save + end)](http://qiita.com/Yinaura/items/c74a09656beda6f02abb)
