## change 

It just verifies that the state has changed. I don't care about "what changed to what" or "how changed".

If you add 1 to x, `change` holds.

     x = 1 expect { x += 1 }.to change { x } # => true 

Even if 2 is added to x, `change` holds.

     x = 1 expect { x += 2 }.to change { x } # => true 

Add 1 to x and subtract 1 more. Since the state has not changed, `change` does not hold.

     x = 1 expect { x += 1; x -= 1; }.to change { x } # => RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError: result should have changed, but is still 1 

## change.by 

Verify the increase or decrease of the value with the relative value.

If the value is increased by 5, `change.by(5)` holds.

     x = 1 expect { x += 5 }.to change { x }.by(5) # => true 

If the value decreases by 5, `change.by(-5)` holds.

     x = 1 expect { x -= 5 }.to change { x }.by(-5) # => true 

As we do not verify "absolute value" after increase and decrease, we are careful. For example, when calculating 3 + 4, `change.by(7)` does not hold.

     x = 3 expect { x += 4 }.to change { x }.by(7) # => RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError: result should have been changed by 7, but was changed by 4 

The increased value is 4, so it is `change.by(4)` that holds.

     x = 3 expect { x += 4 }.to change { x }.by(4) # => true 

## change.from.to 

Verify what has changed from what state. For example, if you calculate `x = 3 + 4` , the value changes from 3 to 7.

Therefore, `change.from(3).to(7)` holds.

     x = 3 expect { x += 4 }.to change { x }.from(3).to(7) # => true
