# Solution 

Register the command you want to run before push as a git alias.

     [push] default = current [alias] before-push = !bundle exec rubocop && bundle exec rake notes && echo 'sleep 10 seconds and you will push' && sleep 10 gentle-push = !git before-push && git push 

Then you can use `$ git gentle-push` .

Above is an example of running rubocop (Ruby's grammar checker) and notes (a task that finds annotations).

# result 

Like this.

# Description 

- Sleeping for 10 seconds is to allow Command + C to exit when something goes wrong. Note that it does not stop automatically. 
- I want you to rewrite necessary parts timely. For example, make push be push -f. 

# combination 

It would be nice to put [an alias](http://qiita.com/Yinaura/items/562b09ec4c7ad93ed2ab) that [rebases the current branch into the "latest master" with one command in](http://qiita.com/Yinaura/items/562b09ec4c7ad93ed2ab) before-push.

     [push] default = current [alias] new-world = !git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout - && git rebase master before-push = !git new-world && bundle exec rubocop && bundle exec rake notes && echo 'sleep 5 seconds and you will push' && sleep 5 

# problem 

Often you forget what you want to run before push. It is better to understand the mistake at hand.

# environment 

- git version 2.3.8 (Apple Git-58) 
- Mac OSX Yosemite
