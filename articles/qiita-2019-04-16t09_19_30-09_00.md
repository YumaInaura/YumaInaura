`$ bundle install -j4`

 

This will install in 4 parallels.

4 is the number of workers launched. The reason "4" is because it matches the number of CPU cores of the terminal.

So, if you have 8 cores to run, maybe `$ bundle install -j8` is fine.

Since search did not hit even if it searched by "bundle install speed", it posts.

Specifically [, parallel processing](http://qiita.com/camelmasa/items/5ca27ab398f105f86c76) in [Bundler? ? How to handle bundle install at detonation speed.](http://qiita.com/camelmasa/items/5ca27ab398f105f86c76) See

Official: http://bundler.io/v1.5/whats\_new.html (According to this comment, speed improvement of 40%-60% seems to be expected)
