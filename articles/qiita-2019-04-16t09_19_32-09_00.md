Hold down Option and press \.

It depends on the keyboard though. The \ is probably next to the backspace (BS)!

## Aside 

After using the Mac. I spent about 2 months without entering a backslash.

I have read the [commentary](http://qiita.com/miyohide/items/6cb8967282d4b2db0f61) several times. I was blind and kept pressing \ instead of \.

It was the source of the most misunderstanding. On Windows, \ and \ are the same thing, but on Mac they are different things.
