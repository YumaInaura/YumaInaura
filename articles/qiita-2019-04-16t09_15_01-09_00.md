# Solution 

It's a simple way. Write the validation value as a constant.

     class Book < ActiveRecord::Base TITLE_MAXIMUM_LENGTH = 100 validates :title, length: { maximum: TITLE_MAXIMUM_LENGTH } end 

# reference 

     Book::TITLE_MAXIMUM_LENGTH # => 20 

# Improvement 

It's redundant as it is. Write in one line using the return value of the constant declaration.

     class Book < ActiveRecord::Base validates :title, length: { maximum: TITLE_MAXIMUM_LENGTH = 100 } end 

# Supplement 

`Book.validators_on(:title)` method returns an array. It was troublesome to get the value of specific validation, so this method was used.

Please let me know if there is something else.
