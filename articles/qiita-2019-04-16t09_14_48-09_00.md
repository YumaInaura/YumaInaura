# Solution 

Make a symbolic link to your home directory at the root.

`$ sudo ln -s ~/ /a/`

 

This solves it!

`$ /a/`

 

Can handle home directories. Trouble is less than one-fifth of tilda. (Feeling)

# Operation check 

Let's create a file.

     $ touch /a/example.txt $ ls ~/ | grep example.txt example.txt 

It's right.

# Reason for the / a / symbolic link 

Because a is very easy to hit.

The first letter of home may be `h` , but the keystroke is not good.

# problem 

To move to your home directory, just type `cd` . (No need to pass anything after the `cd` )

     $ cd $ pwd /Users/yinaura 

But. If you want to handle home directories from within other directories, you have to hit the tilde.

`$ cat ~/example.text`

 

I'm sorry.
