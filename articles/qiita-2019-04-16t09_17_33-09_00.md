# problem 

Put ActiveAdmin's gem in Rails. `$ rails server` error occurred when trying to launch a `$ rails server` with `$ rails server` .

     TypeError: superclass mismatch for class Application 

# Solution 

The cause was that the Rails project name was "active\_admin". (I gave this name for the test)

Another project name is OK.

     $ rails new active_admin_test
