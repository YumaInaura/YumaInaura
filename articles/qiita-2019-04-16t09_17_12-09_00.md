# problem 

If you write `accessor = [value]` in initialize. Ruby seems to be an assignment to a local variable.

     class Book attr_accessor :price def initialize price = 1080 end end 

Even when calling the accessor. `price = 1080` which should be assigned as initial value does not come out.

     book = Book.new p book.price # => nil 

# Solution 

Write `self.price = xxxx` instead of `price = xxxx` .

     class Book attr_accessor :price def initialize self.price = 1080 end end 

     book = Book.new p book.price # => 1080 

This is ok.

# environment 

- ruby 2.0.0
