x `User.delete(name: 'Alice')`  
o `User.where(name: 'Alice').destroy_all`

User.delete class method is not like "where" style
User.delete class mathod takes id or ids in arguments

```rb
User.delete(name: 'Alice')
  User Destroy (0.7ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = NULL
=> 0
```

Specify id

```rb
User.delete(24)
  User Destroy (2.8ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 24
=> 1
```

Specify ids

```rb
User.delete([25,26])
  User Destroy (5.0ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` IN (25, 26)
=> 2
```

return value is "deleted recourds" num

btw User.destory class method not exists

```rb
User.destroy(name: 'Alice')
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find User with 'id'={:name=>"Alice"}
```

You must find user instance and delete
But delete not consider abount association

```rb
User.find_by(name: 'Alice').delete
  # User Load (0.9ms)  SELECT  `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`name` = 'Alice' LIMIT 1
  # User Destroy (3.1ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 12
```

You must use "destory" usally because "destroy" take care abount association

```rb
User.find_by(name: 'Alice').destroy
#  User Load (0.6ms)  SELECT  `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`name` = 'Alice' LIMIT 1
#   (0.4ms)  BEGIN
#  User Destroy (0.8ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 23
#   (1.5ms)  COMMIT
```

You can delete multiple records with "where" and "delete_all"

```rb
[79] pry(main)> User.where(name: 'Alice').delete_all
  User Destroy (3.7ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`name` = 'Alice'
=> 2
```

You can delete multiple records with "where" and "destroy_all"

```rb
[82] pry(main)> User.where(name: 'Alice').destroy_all
  User Load (0.8ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`name` = 'Alice'
   (0.7ms)  BEGIN
  User Destroy (3.3ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 21
   (6.1ms)  COMMIT
   (0.6ms)  BEGIN
  User Destroy (0.9ms)  DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 22
   (3.4ms)  COMMIT
