By the way, `TIMESTAMP_TO_USEC` has the same function, but it receives a timestamp instead of a string.

> Date\_string must have the format YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM: SS [.uuuuuu]. The fractional part of the second part can be up to 6 digits long or can be omitted.

Results: 1272672000000000

## UTC _USEC_ TO\_WEEK (\<UNIX timestamp\>, \<day of the week\>) 

Returns a UNIX timestamp in microseconds.

First is the "UNIX timestamp" in microseconds. Second, give the day of the week between 0 (Sunday) and 6 (Saturday).

For example, giving a Unix timestamp on Friday, April 11, 2008. If you give 2 (Tuesday) on the day of the week.

Returns the UNIX microseconds of April 18, 2008 (Tuesday).

> This function takes two arguments: a UNIX timestamp in microseconds, and a day of the week from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).
> 
> For example, if unix _timestamp occurs on Friday, 2008-04-11, and you set day of_ week to 2 (Tuesday), the function returns a UNIX timestamp for Tuesday, 2008-04-08.

> _For example, if unix_ timestamp occurs in 2010, the function returns 1274259481071200, the microsecond representation of 2010-01-01 00:00. Returns a UNIX timestamp in microseconds that represent the year of the unix _timestamp argument_ .

     SELECT UTC_USEC_TO_YEAR(1274259481071200); 

Results: 1262304000000000

## WEEK (\<time stamp\>)

This "week" starts on Sunday.

So, for example, if January 1 is non-Sunday, the week of "1" has less than 7 days. In this case, the first Sunday will be included in the "2" week.

> Weeks begin on Sunday, so if January 1 is on a day other than Sunday, week 1 has more than 7 days and the first Sunday of the year is the first day of week 2.

     SELECT WEEK(TIMESTAMP('2014-12-31')); 

Results: 53

## YEAR (\<time stamp\>) 

Given a timestamp returns the year.

> Returns the year of a TIMESTAMP data type.

     SELECT YEAR(TIMESTAMP('2012-10-02 05:23:48')); 

The result: 2012
