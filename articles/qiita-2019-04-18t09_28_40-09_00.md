<h1> I feel that I have received a DM on Twitter every day recently. </h1><p> Much more than Wantedly. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118468366803451904">2019-04-17 10:56:53 UTC</a> </p><h1> Wantedly is Wantedly and it seems that it will cost money to send scout emails from recruiters, and it seems that there is a mechanism that does not become an illegal area. </h1><p> On the other hand, if the applicant does not enter from himself, it may be difficult for the recruiter to come to the scout. </p><p> Speaking of which, the monthly premium contract made it easy for scouts to come. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118468817754128384">2019-04-17 10:58:40 UTC</a> </p><h1> Even in the case of Twitter communication, there are various things from rude people to really good people, and in the moment you receive a message, what is this freshness? ! Some people think that. </h1><p> After all that&#39;s where I want to be instinctively like this part. I also had a feeling that my previous job really matched my skin from the interview stage. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118469535449751552">2019-04-17 11:01:32 UTC</a> </p><h1> One thing I would like to pay attention to is that I do not want to become a former Garrant who says that the previous job is the last job. </h1><p> I can not but use words to explain. </p><p> Because it looks like a former Kanogar alien called a former Kano-a former Kano-. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118470236489994240">2019-04-17 11:04:19 UTC</a> </p><h1> After that, no matter how much work invitations come, I just want to keep in mind that I&#39;m not that awesome. </h1><p> Basically, you can see only part of your career from other people. </p><p> Apparently, the ability to build a career &quot;in front of you&quot; would be great. From now on it&#39;s a critical moment. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118471062591684608">2019-04-17 11:07:36 UTC</a> </p><h1> By the way, from the point of my character, I felt that I would never visit the timing of giving up and having confidence in myself. </h1><p> But that&#39;s fine. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118471294373089282">2019-04-17 11:08:31 UTC</a> </p><h1> After this, in the engineering industry of this too human resources, skill difference with other people is very anxious, but skill difference that goes beyond human knowledge so that it becomes red if you interact with jealousy If not, naturally, some may be leveled and familiar with the surrounding environment. </h1><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118472036165148672">2019-04-17 11:11:28 UTC</a> </p><h1> People who are able to work in &quot;previous job&quot; who is said to be reasonably skillful, there are prides that have been evaluated as having no technical problems, but in the end technology skills, although they can not work, environment and context The dependence will be big, and the high ones will look low and the low ones will be low, and vice versa. </h1><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118472635040407552">2019-04-17 11:13:51 UTC</a> </p><h1> The general term for high skill and low skill is how vague, baseless and fluffy it seems. </h1><p> Even if it is an engineer of Google, it is a lack of ability if it sees from the alien and is subject to firing? Welcome to UFO, Inc. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118473025622396928">2019-04-17 11:15:24 UTC</a> </p><h1> By the way, if there is a climate change like now, according to a place that consumes a large amount of energy by intense programming, it may be coming to a good eye like this time. </h1><p> However, even if you go back to the past now, there was no option to not program. </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118473697923223552">2019-04-17 11:18:04 UTC</a> </p><h1> So I&#39;m planning to talk about work on Skype etc. continuously for four days from today, but it was good that the MacBook stand I used at work seemed to be useful. </h1><p> I wonder if the online meeting looks great with a slight angle of face, or it looks uncomfortable to the other party. <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4WemStU4AI5dE9.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4WemSuUEAEvyFu.jpg" alt="image"></p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118474468421062656">2019-04-17 11:21:08 UTC</a> </p><h1> So I&#39;m planning to talk about work on Skype etc. Continuously for four days from today, but it was good that the MacBook stand I used at work seemed to be useful. </h1><p> I wonder if the online meeting looks great with a slight angle of face, or it looks uncomfortable to the other </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/YumaInaura/status/1118474960798830592">2019-04-17 11:23:05 UTC</a> </p>
