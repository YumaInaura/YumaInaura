# .select 

For example, if you write Only id columns can be obtained as internally issued SQL.

     User.select(:id) 

Let's check it in practice. ( _`users`_ the part of _`users` . `id`_ )

     User.select(:id).to_sql # => "SELECT `users`.`id` FROM `users`" 

Of course, in this case, "unspecified columns" can not be obtained on the object. Even if you get only id, you can't use name to send it out. k.

     User.select(:id).first.name # => NoMethodError: undefined method `name' 

# Use 

There is a huge amount of data in one column. Use it when eating memory.

(There is also a story that you can get only the columns you need at any time.)

# Rails 3 or earlier 

The way to write is old in Rails3. The following syntax is obsolete in Rails 4.

     User.all(:select => 'id')
