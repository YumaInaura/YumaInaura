`Alt + ← →` can move with `Alt + ← →` . (Hold down Alt while pressing the left and right keys)

If it is Mac, it is `Command + []` .

You can move the channel like "forward" or "back". By the way, just looking at the channel will be recorded in the history and will be the target of movement.

# Supplement 

- ← Left is old, right → is new, 
- You can not move while entering a comment. You can move if you delete the comment. 
- Not only the channel movement, but also the history of opening and closing the sidebar seems to be traced. (I do not understand well) 
- As of October 2015, it is not listed in the app's shortcut help. (Listed on the official site shortcut)
