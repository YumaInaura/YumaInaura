# Solution 

Open Find in Files with **Ctrl + Shift + F.** Then, you can search by **leaving** `Where:` **blank**.

Now regardless of what the "currently open file" is. You can search from the entire project.

# problem 

Until now

1. Open the top level directory file to search from the current directory 
2. Search in the condition of `Where: ./` 

It was a bother because I was taking the procedure.

`Where: /` did not work well.

# environment 

- Sublime Text 3
