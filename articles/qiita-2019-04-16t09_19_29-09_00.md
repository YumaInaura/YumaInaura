# Method 1 

As ActiveAdmin prepares seed file

`$ rake db:seed` .

In this case, the following data is probably created.

email: admin@example.com password: password

(See db / seeds.rb for details)

# Method 2 

May be created directly with pry (the Rails console).

Move to a project

`cd /path/to/project`

 

Launch the Rails console.

`$ bundle exec rails console`

 

Execute ActiveAdmin's user creation method.

`pry(main)> AdminUser.create!(:email => 'admin@example.com', :password => 'password')`

 

The entered password is encrypted and a user is created.

### version 

- ActiveAdmin 4.2.4 

### Supplement 

[Based on creating Rails administration screen in ActiveAdmin](http://easyramble.com/rails-active-admin.html) .

The above page passes the parameter password\_confirmation, which was not necessary in my environment. It works just by specifying email and password.
