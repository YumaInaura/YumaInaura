Switcher can be started with `Ctrl + k` .

1. Enter the channel name you want to move 
2. Determined by up / down on the keyboard + Enter 

This is the fastest!

# Hint 

- The channel name does not have to be entered from the beginning. For example, if the channel name is **# hobby-game** , it will be completed even if you start the input from the later _game_ . 
- There is no need to write hyphens and underscores. For example, if the channel name is **# cat-food**. You can enter catfood (completely connect and write) or cat food (insert a space). (Reduction of the number of typing!) 
- Especially as the number of channels increases, this switcher is effective.
