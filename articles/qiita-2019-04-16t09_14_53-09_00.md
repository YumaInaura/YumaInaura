## 1. Add a gem 

In the familiar Gemfile. Install the resque body and the resque-scheduler.

     gem 'resque' gem 'resque-scheduler' 

     $ bundle install 

## 2. Write the processing content to the model 

Write the **processing you want the worker to finally execute in** the perform method of the model. Here, as a test, create a process that only produces standard output.

     class Example @queue = :default def self.perform p 'Hello Sword!' end end 

## 3. Add settings for workers 

You only need to add two lines to the Rakefile.

     require 'resque/tasks' require 'resque/scheduler/tasks' 

## 4. Start up the resque worker 

First of all, start the worker of resque itself. (not resque-scheduler's)

`$ TERM_CHILD=1 QUEUES=* bundle exec rake environment resque:work`

 

It will be in the following state.

Let's leave this and move on to the next.

## 5. Launch the resque-scheduler worker 

**It is** necessary to **launch separately from the worker of the resque body**. So run in another window

`$ bundle exec rake resque:scheduler`

 

It will be in the following state.

## 6. Register a job 

In addition, let's add a job in a **separate window from** the **two workers**. In other words, three windows are used.

It's easy to use the Rails console.

`$ bundle exec rails console`

 

     irb(main)> Resque.enqueue_in(5.second, Example) => true 

By the way, this means "register the job 5 seconds from now".

## 6. The job is run 

After a while, let's look at the worker of the main body of resque, which was launched in **step 1**. **You will see** that the job **"standard output string"** is being executed.
