# React 

It includes the fact that rendering logic is intrinsically tied to other UI logic: how to handle events, aging of states, and how to prepare to display data.

# By putting markup and logic in separate files 

Rather than artificially separating technology, React separates concerns in loosely coupled units called "components" that contain both. We will come back to the components in a further section, but if you are not yet familiar with putting markup in JS, this story may convince you otherwise.

# React does not need to use JSX, but
