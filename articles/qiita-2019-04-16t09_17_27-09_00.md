should\_receive verifies that a method of a certain class is called.

### success 

I expect SomeModel.create to be called.

     it do SomeModel.should_receive(:create) SomeModel.create end 

As an example, we call SomeModel.create right after here.

For example, in other methods. In the processing of the controller etc. It will succeed if SomeModel.create is called from anywhere or once.

### Failure 

It does not make sense to execute a method **before** should\_receive.

     it do SomeModel.create SomeModel.should_receive(:create) end 

## .with 

.with verifies that the method is called with specific arguments.

### Successful example 

     it do SomeModel.should_receive(:create).with)(title: 'Bible') SomeModel.create(title: 'Bible') end 

### Failure 

     it do SomeModel.should_receive(:create).with)(title: 'Bible') SomeModel.create(title: 'Gone with the wind') end 

## Supplement 

Since should is old, newer versions should use expect. http://qiita.com/shuhei/items/58452ad1572b7e40c150
