# Answer 

It is good to register an alias in .gitconfig.

     [alias] new-world = !git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout - && git rebase master 

with this.

Just type `$ git new-world` You can easily follow the latest master. (If there is no conflict)

## Explanation of command 

Multiple commands are executed in order.

### `$ git checkout master` 
 

=\> Check out to master.

### `$ git pull origin master` 
 

Bring the master up to date.

### `$ git checkout -` 
 

Return to work branch.

### `$ git rebase master` 
 

Make the working branch follow the master.

## command 

`$ git new-world`

 
# Motive 

March 2016. There is a specification change in GitHub.

The branch is not up-to-date. I had to press the Update Branch button on the screen.

Because of this, it was tempting to keep the working branch up-to-date.

# environment 

- Github (as of March 7, 2016) 
- git version 2.3.8 (Apple Git-58)
