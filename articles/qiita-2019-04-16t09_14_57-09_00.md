# Conclusion 

Register an alias in `.gitconfig` .

(With! At the beginning, write the command directly)

     [alias] rbi = !git rebase -i $(git merge-base master HEAD) 

Run.

`$ git rbi`

 

Result is.

Good vibes!

# problem 

"Rebase from the current branch root in interactive mode" This is a messy command. Even though it is used frequently. Really troublesome.

But. It is useless to register an alias in .gitconfig.

     [alias] rbi = rebase -i $(git merge-base master HEAD) 

Because `$(git merge-base master HEAD)` is a command.

However, it was found that shell commands can be registered by writing! At the beginning. So the solution is at the beginning.

# environment 

- git version 2.3.8 
- Mac (OSX)
