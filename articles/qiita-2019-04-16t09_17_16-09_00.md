## first 

Return the first element. that's all.

     [5,4,3,2,1].first # => 5 

## last 

Return the last element. that's all.

     [5,4,3,2,1].last # => 1 

## begin 

Return the first element in the range. (\* 2) It looks like the first version of Range.

     (5..1).begin # => 5 

Actually, begin is the same as first. You can write either. (\* 1)

     (5..1).first # => 5 

But you can not use begin on ordinary arrays.

     [5,4,3,2,1].begin # => NoMethodError: undefined method `begin' for [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:Array 

## end 

Return the last element in the range. (\* 2) It looks like last in the Range version.

     (5..1).end # => 1 

In fact, end is the same as last. You can write either. (\* 1)

     (5..1).last # => 1 

However, you can not use end for ordinary arrays.

     [5,4,3,2,1].end # => NoMethodError: undefined method `end' for [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:Array 

# min 

Returns the smallest element in the array. The order of the elements does not matter.

     [5,4,-3,2,1].min # => -3 

# max 

Returns the largest element in the array. The order of the elements does not matter.

     [5,4,30,2,1].max # => 30 

# Annotation 

- 

\* 1) Strictly speaking, there is a difference between taking and not taking arguments. If you do not pass an argument will be the same behavior.

- 

\* 2) The "first element" of Range is the beginning. It is better to say that the "last element" is the end. Ruby's "scope" is relatively complicated, so please refer to the comments in this article.
