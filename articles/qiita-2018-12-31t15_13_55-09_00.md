# User maybe doest notice "Why its good or bad"

- For understanding user must thinking about that reason

# Thinking user example

- In this case pinned all tab are left side
- So user do not confused and does not make important tab hard to find place
- and favicon only it is so distinguishable from others  

# Are you UI UX service developer?

- Lets make your self super example
- You is most friendly user in the world you know
- lets think "why you choose it" by your brain and use mindfulness technique :)
