Create your own private channel.

You can write anything.

# Why take notes on Slack? 

Why use Slack instead of using other memo tools?

For example, in my case. I'm using lack all day, quite heavy. It always feels like the Slack app is up and ready.

So if you take notes with Slack, the **overhead is minimal and you can reach** the **act of "** taking **notes" as fast as possible**. The same interface as when using other channels. Common windows. You can write notes with a common shortcut. This ease is great.

URL you want to remember. Code fragment. Comment being edited. I will make a note of those things in a boiled dish.

It's more like scribbling than organized notes.

I often use Slack. I want to take notes quickly anyway. Especially recommended for such people.
