# problem 

For example, if you write a subquery like this, you get angry.

     SELECT * FROM ( SELECT User from user ); 

     => ERROR 1248 (42000): Every derived table must have its own alias 

# Solution 

Give some table name (alias name) in AS.

     SELECT * FROM ( SELECT User from user ) AS account; 

     +-----------+ | User | +-----------+ | mysql.sys | | root | +-----------+ 

# the reason 

If you do not write AS, SQL is interpreted syntactically like "FROM (without table name)".

# environment 

- mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.12, for osx 10.11 (x86\_64) using EditLine wrapper
