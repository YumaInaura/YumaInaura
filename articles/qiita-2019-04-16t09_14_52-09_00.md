# Solution 

Put rb-readline with pry-rails.

     gem 'pry-rails' gem 'rb-readline' 

`$ bundle install`

 

Launch the Rails console.

`$ bundle exec rails console`

 

This is the solution! You can use the up and down keys on the keyboard to follow previous input history.

# problem 

pry doesn't record input history at all.

To be precise, it will remember during one session. `exit` , everything disappears at the next start.

By default all history settings are true. I also confirmed that `.pry_history` exists.

     Pry.config.history.should_save # => true Pry.config.history.should_load # => true Pry.config.history.file # => "/Users/yinaura/.pry_history" 

And despite the **history being written to**.pry\_history. **It can not only read**.

It was useless to write load processing to .pryrc.

     Pry.history.load 

However. Manually run `Pry.history.load` after launching `Pry.history.load` to load the history. But it's too much trouble to do every time.

The solution is at the beginning.
