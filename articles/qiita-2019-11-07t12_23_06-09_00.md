# Mac = host で SOCKS proxy を起動させておく

```
ssh -vND 8888 user@host
```


# docker コンテナで proxy 接続を確認

`host.docker.internal` を利用

proxy利用時と非利用時でIPが変わっていたら成功

```
$ docker run -it alpine ash
/ # apk add curl
/ # curl  https://httpbin.org/ip
/ # https_proxy=socks5://host.docker.internal:8888 curl  https://httpbin.org/ip
```

>I WANT TO CONNECT FROM A CONTAINER TO A SERVICE ON THE HOST
The host has a changing IP address (or none if you have no network access). From 18.03 onwards our recommendation is to connect to the special DNS name host.docker.internal, which resolves to the internal IP address used by the host. This is for development purpose and will not work in a production environment outside of Docker Desktop for Mac.

>The gateway is also reachable as gateway.docker.internal.
