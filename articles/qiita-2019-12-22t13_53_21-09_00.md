I searched a lot but couldn't find it.

Here's how to test for a trial period, but what you want to do, for example, is to make the next charge for the recurring payment you just made, without waiting tomorrow.

It seems that the billing cycle could be changed, but it didn't seem like a new claim would be immediate.
https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle#changing

Is there a way to expedite recurring payments? Isn't it in the first place?
I feel that there was somewhere in the documentation written to test in as short a cycle as possible, such as timing recurring payments on days instead of months.

In the first place, I wonder if something that does not conform to the actual behavior of Stripe can not be executed even in tests.
If Stripe itself doesn't have a way to speed up recurring payments, it couldn't be tested.

Stripe has a very kind API and interface, but after doing that Stripe, I found that there wasn't a way to find nothing if I searched so far. Finally.
