The x option will ignore spaces.

## problem 

For example, what is the following regular expression doing? Can you imagine at a glance?

     /\A(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{1,3})|(\d{3}-\d{1,3})|(\d{1,9})\z/ 

I do not understand.

## Solution 

If you specify the x option as follows: **Ignore space** And regular expressions that are difficult to understand in the first place. You can make it a little easier to read.

     /\A ( \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{1,3}) | (\d{3}-\d{1,3}) | (\d{1,9} ) \z/x 

## More readable (break line) 

It is also possible to break the line if it is a permissible programming language.

     / \A (\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{1,3}) | (\d{3}-\d{1,3}) | (\d{1,9}) \z /x 

## What's wrong? 

- Is not it a problem of getting used to? 
- In the case of regular expressions, it is common to "pack and write" for some reason. But imagine, for example, "write programming code without line breaks" or "write SQL without line breaks".
